			<p>The “Indian Music Scene” has been morphing into quite an epicenter, welcoming influential thoughts from all around the world. To start with, it already had a very strong foundation of Hindustani and Carnatic Classical music. And thanks to Bollywood for becoming the epitome of an encouragement to many of us in experimenting and contributing in our own little way. And every now and then a few among us with experience a breakthrough and take their thought to the next level. Whether it is an original composition or a re-mastering a classic or rendering a popular number, there is creativity involved.</p>

			<p>ChutneyBlues salutes the creativity of all those artists who strives to make this world a better place each day. We owe our roots to traditional Indian music – both classical and folk. And we have been influenced by music from all over the world – Classic rock, Blues, Jazz, Reggae and Country music. And we strive to strike a harmony among all of these.</p>

			<p>ChutneyBlues is Sangeeta Roy and Dipanjan Paul.</p>

			  <p>Sangeeta owes a lot to her dad for identifying and inducting her into a world of music at a very early age. Her dad, being an able vocalist himself, was able to guide her through some of the initial years. While she was still getting started to build a life around music, she had to deal with an ardent blow of the loss of her father at an early age. Life was challenging, but not enough to dent her passion for music. It also taught her how to deal with challenges and keep her passion alive. And to this day, she has managed to keep her passion alive and kicking and at the same time dealing with the rigor of family and job life.</P>
			  
			  <p>Sangeeta wants to use her talent and gift of music to make a difference to the community and the world. She works with a variety of charitable institutions to raise funds and awareness for a number of causes that are very close to her heart.</p>

			  <p>Dipanjan had been a very happy go lucky character and a music enthusiast since his childhood days. Never been formally trained, he depends primarily on his listening skills and every source of knowledge that he can get his hands on to further his learning. A firm believer of the phrase "Miles to go before I sleep..." With the guitar as his weapon of choice and his knowledge with the technology of music programming and recording, he has been able to put 2 and 2 together and create some catchy stuff.</P>
			  
			  <p>Dipanjan wants to devote his skills, energy and time raising and supporting funds and awareness for worthy causes and is open to collaborate for such purposes.</p>
